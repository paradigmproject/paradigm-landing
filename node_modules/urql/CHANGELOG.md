## [v1.5.1](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/compare/v1.5.0...v1.5.1)

- Replace `fast-json-stable-stringify` with embedded code (see [#426](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/426))
- ⚠ Prevent caching `null` data (see [#437](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/437))

## [v1.5.0](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/compare/v1.4.1...v1.5.0)

This release finally adds shortcuts to imperatively make queries and mutations.
They make it easier to quickly use the client programmatically, either with
a Wonka source-based or Promise-based call.

```js
// Call .query or .mutation which return Source<OperationResult>
const source = client.query(doc, vars);
const source = client.mutation(doc, vars);
// Call .toPromise() on the source to get Promise<OperationResult>
const promise = client.query(doc, vars).toPromise();
const promise = client.mutation(doc, vars).toPromise();
```

This version also adds a `useClient` hook as a shortcut for `useContext(Context)`.
We provide a default client that makes requests to `/graphql`. Since that has
confused users before, we now log a warning, when it's used.

- ✨ Implement `client.query()` and `client.mutation()` (see [#405](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/405))
- Fix `useImmediateEffect` for concurrent mode (see [#418](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/418))
- Deconstruct `Wonka.pipe` using a Babel transform (see [#419](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/419))
- ⚠ Add `useClient` hook and warning when default client is used (see [#420](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/420))

## [v1.4.1](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/compare/v1.4.0...v1.4.1)

This release adds "active teardowns" for operations, which means that an exchange can now send a teardown to cancel ongoing operations. The `subscriptionsExchange` for instance now ends ongoing subscriptions proactively if the server says that they've completed! This is also reflected as `fetching: false` in the `useQuery` and `useSubscription` hook.

We've also fixed a small issue with suspense and added all features from `useQuery` to `useSubscription`! This includes the `pause` argument and an `executeSubscription` function.

- ✨ Implement active teardowns and add missing features to `useSubscription` (see [#410](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/410))
- Fix `UseMutationResponse` TypeScript type, by [@jbugman](https://github.com/jbugman) (see [#412](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/412))
- Exclude subscriptions from suspense source (see [#415](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/415))

## [v1.4.0](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/compare/v1.3.0...v1.4.0)

This release removes all metadata for the `@urql/devtools` extension from the core
`urql` package. This data will now be generated internally in the devtools exchange
itself. [Please also upgrade to the latest `@urql/devtools` version if you're using
the extension.](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql-devtools/releases/tag/v0.0.3)

This release has mainly been focused on minor refactors to keep the bundlesize low.
But it also introduces new features, like specifying a default `requestPolicy` and
a new polling option on `useQuery`!

This release also exports `makeResult` and `makeErrorResult`, which will reduce the
boilerplate code that you need for custom fetch exchanges.

- Minor bundlesize optimizations and remove `debugExchange` in production (see [#375](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/375))
- ✨ Add `requestPolicy` option to `Client` to change the default request policy (see [#376](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/376))
- ⚠ Remove dependency on `graphql-tag` and improve `Operation.key` hashing (see [#383](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/383))
- Remove `networkLatency` and `source` metadata from context, and delete `useDevtoolsContext` (see [#387](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/387) and [#388](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/388))
- ✨ Add support for polling with `pollInterval` argument to `useQuery`, by [@mxstbr](https://github.com/mxstbr) (see [#397](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/397))
- ⚠ Prevent `__typename` from being added to the toplevel GraphQL documents (see [#399](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/399))
- Add `operationName` field to `fetch` request body (see [#401](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/401))

## [v1.3.0](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/compare/v1.2.0...v1.3.0)

This release comes with some important fixes and enhancements, which all address
certain edge-cases when using `urql`.

It fixes the `cache-and-network` request policy, which wouldn't always work correctly and issue another network request after resolving a response from the default cache. We also had a major bug in React Native environments where responses wouldn't ever be reflected in the `useQuery` hook's state. Lastly, you can now use `extensions` from your GraphQL servers and modify the `OperationContext` from the hooks options.

- ✨ Add support for `extensions` key in GraphQL responses, by [@adamscybot](https://github.com/adamscybot) (see [#355](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/355))
- ⚠ Fix `cache-and-network` request policy by adding operation flushing to the client (see [#356](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/356))
- Add `fetch` option to the Client so it doesn't have to be polyfilled globally (see [#357](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/357) and [#359](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/359))
- ⚠ Fix `useImmediateState` for React Native environments (see [#358](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/358))
- ✨ Add `context` option to all hooks to allow `OperationContext` to be changed dynamically (see [#351](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/351))
- Add `isClient` option to `ssrExchange` in case `suspense` is activated on the client-side (see [#369](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/369))

## [v1.2.0](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/compare/v1.1.3...v1.2.0)

A release focused on improving developer experience (in preparation for the
upcoming devtools) as well as minor documentation improvements and bug fixes.

- Add metadata to operation context in development (see [#305](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/305), [#324](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/324), [#325](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/325) and [#329](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/329))
- Fix minor typename memory leak (see [#321](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/321))
- Fix types for react subscription components (see [#328](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/328))
- Fix displayName attributes not populated in examples (see [#330](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/330))
- Fix error in `collectTypes` method (see [#343](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/343))
- Fix HTTP status bounds check error (see [#348](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/348/files))

## [v1.1.3](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/compare/v1.1.2...v1.1.3)

This is a hotfix that patches a small regression from `1.1.2` where
`useQuery` would crash due to an incorrect teardown function from pause.

- Fix `executeQuery` dispose function when `pause` is set, by[@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) (see [#315](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/315))

## [v1.1.2](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/compare/v1.1.1...v1.1.2)

This patch fixes a small bug that usually manifests in development,
where the initial state would be incorrect after a fast response from
the GraphQL API. This used to lock the state into `fetching: true`
indefinitely in some cases.

- Export all TS types for components (see [#312](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/312))
- ⚠️ Fix state getting stuck on initial mount for fast responses (see [#310](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/310))
- Refactor build tooling to be driven only by Rollup (see [#306](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/306))
- Remove dev-only dependencies from `dependencies` (see [#304](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/304))

## [v1.1.1](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/compare/v1.1.0...v1.1.1)

This release comes with two small patches. One being a crticial fix,
where cancelled requests would be erroneously deduped, which meant
a previously cancelled query would never be fetched.

It also refactors our bundling process to transpile `Object.assign` to
restore IE11 support and reduce the amount of duplicate helper in our bundles.

- ⚠️ Fix torn-down requests being deduped forever (see [#281](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/281))
- Fix `useQuery`'s `pause` argument blocking explicit `executeQuery` calls (see [#278](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/278))
- Add `Object.assign` transpilation for IE11 and refactor bundling (see [#274](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/274))

## [v1.1.0](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/compare/v1.0.5...v1.1.0)

This release introduces support for **server-side rendering**.
You can find out more about it by reading
[the new Basics section on how to set it up.](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/blob/master/docs/basics.md#server-side-rendering)

This version now also requires a version of React supporting hooks! (>= 16.8.0)
We unfortunately forgot to correct the `peerDependencies` entries in our v1.0.0 release.

- ✨ Add **server-side rendering** support (see [#268](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/268))
- ✨ Ensure that state changes are applied immediately on mount (see [#256](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/256))
- Ensure that effects are run immediately on mount (see [#250](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/250))
- ⚠️ Remove `create-react-context` and bump React peer dependency (see [#252](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/252))
- Add generics to the `Query`, `Mutation`, and `Subscription` components
- ⚠️ Fix issues where `useQuery` wouldn't update or teardown correctly (see [#243](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/243))
- ✨ Add support for `pause` prop/option to `useQuery` and `Query` (see [#237](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/237))

## [v1.0.5](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/compare/v1.0.4...v1.0.5)

- Export `MutationProps` types for TS typings, by [@mxstbr](https://github.com/mxstbr) (see [#236](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/236))
- Export `Use*Args` types for TS typings, by [@mxstbr](https://github.com/mxstbr) (see [#235](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/235))
- Export all hook response types for TS typings, by [@good-idea](https://github.com/good-idea) (see [#233](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/233))
- ⚠ Fix runtime error in `cachExchange` where already deleted keys where being accessed (see [#223](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/223))
- ⚠️ Fix `cacheExchange` not forwarding teardowns correctly, which lead to unnecessary/outdated queries being executed, by [@federicobadini](https://github.com/federicobadini) (see [#222](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/222))
- Change `GraphQLRequest` to always pass on a parsed GraphQL `DocumentNode` instead of just a string, which reduces work (see [#221](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/221))
- Fix incorrect TS types by using `Omit<T, K>` (see [#220](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/220))

## [v1.0.4](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/compare/v1.0.3...v1.0.4)

- Fix `__typename` not being extracted from responses correctly, which broke caching
- Fix `fetchOptions` being called in the client instead of the `fetchExchange`
- Improve `CombinedError` to actually extend `Error` and rehydrate `GraphQLError` instances
- Fix `executeMutation` prop not accepting any generics types

## [v1.0.3](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/compare/v1.0.2...v1.0.3)

- Fix bug where `variables` were only compared using reference equality, leading to
  infinite rerenders

## [v1.0.2](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/compare/v1.0.0...v1.0.2)

- Allow `graphql-tag` / `DocumentNode` usage; Operations' queries can now be `DocumentNode`s
- Generating keys for queries has been optimized

https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/compare/v1.0.4...v1.0.5

## v1.0.0

> Since the entire library has been rewritten for v1.0.0, no changes
> are listed here!

`urql` v1 is more customisable than ever with "Exchanges", which
allow you to change every aspect of how `urql` works.
